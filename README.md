## Review From Feedback
Feedback: Feedback from user experience (UX) testing by classmates and peers highlighted several issues. The application's design was considered too plain and visually unappealing. Users also struggled with navigation due to unclear and unintuitive options. Additionally, the system allowed multiple accounts to be registered with the same email address, leading to confusion and potential security concerns.


### Feedback: 
Users found the navigation to be confusing and not intuitive. They reported difficulty in finding key features and sections within the application. The lack of clear navigation cues made it challenging for users to efficiently interact with the application.

### Modifications:
In response to this feedback, the following modifications were made to the prototype,
1. Imporved Navigation: More obvious navigation links were added to the user home page. These links provide clear and direct paths to the main sections of the application, making it easier for users to find and access the features they need.
2. Carousel Display: A carousel display was introduced on the home page. This carousel rotates through the different website features available to the user, providing a dynamic and engaging way to highlight the application's capabilities. It helps users quickly understand what features are available and how to access them.
3. Improved Styling: Additional styling was applied to the application to enhance its visual appeal. This includes better use of colors, fonts, and layouts to create a more attractive and cohesive design. The improved styling makes the application more inviting and user-friendly.
4. Email Validation: Implemented validation checks to ensure that each email address can only be associated with a single user account, preventing the registration of multiple accounts with the same email address.
